Designed and developed this website using Flask, Python, Jinja and Flask-freezer.


This is a portfolio project for me to showcase my work. 

I designed and developed this website using the following :

<ul>
<li> Flask </li>
<li> Python </li>
<li> Jinja </li>
<li> Flask-freezer </li>
<li> Markdown </li>
<li> GitHub </li>
<li> Netlify </li>
</ul>

Content is written in markdown and stored in the `src/pages` directory.
This is because I wanted to be able to write content in markdown and have it rendered as HTML on the website.

The website is currently configured to either run as a Flask app or 
it can be built into a static site using Flask-freezer.

To run the Flask web app:

<em>
python app.py
</em>

and to build the static site using Flask-freezer:

<em>
python freezer.py
</em>

output will be in the `build` directory.

The website is hosted on Netlify and the source code is available on GitHub at the following link
