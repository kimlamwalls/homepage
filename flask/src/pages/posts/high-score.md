High Score is a co-writing workshop that teaches composers, songwriters, and sound designers how to create and implement dynamic music and sounds for games. As part of this workshop, my assigned partner, Jane Wei, and I composed and implemented music and sounds for a portion of a game. The game we worked on was a segment of Paperbark by Paper House Games.

Here is a demo of the music and sounds we created for the game.
