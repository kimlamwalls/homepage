My first game jam! An in person jam hosted by Paper House Games in Melbourne. 
The theme was the Women's Weekly birthday cake book.
We were fairly ambitious for a 2-day jam with not much jam experience across the whole team.
But we had the best time!! Learnt heaps, and had something at least presentable at the end :)
Look forward to hopefully doing more jams in the future.

I would highly recommend joining in game jams regardless of your skill level or background!
