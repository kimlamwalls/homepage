# Homepage/Portfolio

This is a portfolio project for me to showcase my work. 

I designed and developed this website using the following :

- Flask
- Python
- Jinja
- Flask-freezer
- Markdown
- GitHub
- Netlify

Content is written in markdown and stored in the `src/pages` directory.
This is because I wanted to be able to write content in markdown and have it rendered as HTML on the website.

The website is currently configured to either run as a Flask app or 
it can be built into a static site using Flask-freezer.

To run the Flask web app:

```bash
python app.py
```
and to build the static site using Flask-freezer:

```bash
python freezer.py
```
output will be in the `build` directory.

The website is hosted on Netlify and the source code is available on GitHub.
